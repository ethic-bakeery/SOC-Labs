# üß† Memory Dump Investigation ‚Äì Reminiscent (HTB Challenge)

In this challenge, we are provided with a memory dump file named `flounder-pc-memdump.elf`. Alongside that, there are other supporting files, which are just for reference and to provide more context about the incident.

The main goal here is to analyze the memory dump and investigate what occurred, how it happened, and extract any potential indicators‚Äîespecially the **flag**.

---

## üìß Initial Clue ‚Äì Analyzing the Email

I started the investigation by opening and carefully reading the `Resume.eml` file.

This file contains a suspicious link:

```
http://10.10.99.55:8080/resume.zip
```

I took note of the IP address `10.10.99.55` as it might play a critical role in later analysis.

---

## üß¨ Memory Profiling

Before diving deep into the memory dump analysis, I first needed to determine the profile of the memory using **Volatility v2**.

**Command run:**
```bash
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf imageinfo
```

![profile](./mem/hprofile.PNG)

This command gives us the correct profile to use for further plugins.

---

## üåê Network Connections ‚Äì netscan

To verify if any suspicious communication occurred (e.g., resume.zip being downloaded), I checked active and past connections using `netscan`.

**Command run:**
```bash
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 netscan
```

![netscan](./mem/netscan1.PNG)  
![netscan](./mem/netscan2.PNG)

From the scan, I noticed a connection from the internal IP to the external IP `10.10.99.55`, triggered by the `powershell.exe` process. That raised suspicion.

---

## üìÇ File Discovery ‚Äì filescan

I then searched for the suspicious `resume` file to confirm it was downloaded on the system.

**Command run:**
```bash
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep resume
```

![filescan](./mem/filescan.PNG)

The file was located on the Desktop of the user.

---

## üß™ Extracting the LNK File

Next, I dumped the `.lnk` file that looked suspicious (a shortcut file to launch the malicious process).

**Command run:**
```bash
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q <OFFSET> -D powershell_dump
```

‚úÖ Replace `<OFFSET>` with the physical offset found via `filescan`.  
‚úÖ `powershell_dump` is the directory to store the dumped file.

---

## üîé Analyzing the LNK File

Once dumped, I ran the `strings` command on it:

**Command run:**
```bash
strings powershell_dump/resume.lnk
```

I discovered a long encoded PowerShell command that started with:

```
cABvAHcAZQByAHMAaABlAGwAbAAgAC0AbgBvAFAAIAAtAHMAdABh...
```

![string01](./mem/string01.PNG)  
![string02](./mem/string02.PNG)

It was clearly Base64-encoded PowerShell in UTF-16LE format.

---

## üîì Decoding Stage 1

I decoded the initial Base64 UTF-16 string using:

**Command run:**
```bash
cat encoded.txt | base64 -d | iconv -f utf-16le -t utf-8
```

![decode](./mem/encode01.PNG)

This revealed another base64-encoded PowerShell payload (second stage), embedded using the `-enc` flag.

---

## üîì Decoding Stage 2

I extracted and decoded the second base64 string using the same technique:

**Command run:**
```bash
cat encode_stage2.txt | base64 -d | iconv -f utf-16le -t utf-8
```

![encoded_second_stage](./mem/encoded_second_stage.PNG)

The decoded output revealed a full PowerShell payload designed to:
- Disable script block logging
- Bypass AMSI
- Use RC4 encryption
- Set up a WebClient and send a request with a session cookie

It finally downloaded a file from:
```
http://10.10.99.55:80/login/process.php
```

and attempted to decrypt it to execute further payloads.

---

## üèÅ Finding the Flag

Towards the end of the script, I discovered the hardcoded flag:

```
HTB{redacted}
```

![flag](./mem/flag.PNG)

(Flag hidden in red in the screenshot)

## ‚úÖ Summary of Commands Used

```bash
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf imageinfo
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 netscan
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep resume
volatility -f flounder-pc-memdump.elf --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q <OFFSET> -D powershell_dump
strings powershell_dump/resume.lnk
cat encoded.txt | base64 -d | iconv -f utf-16le -t utf-8
cat encode_stage2.txt | base64 -d | iconv -f utf-16le -t utf-8
```

## üí° Conclusion

This challenge is a clear demonstration of how PowerShell can be used in memory-based attacks and how attackers hide malicious scripts in encoded form to avoid detection. The use of `.lnk` files, PowerShell obfuscation, and memory-resident payloads are classic indicators of an advanced intrusion.

The attacker:
- Sent a phishing email with a malicious `.lnk` file
- Used PowerShell to download and execute further encrypted payloads
- Bypassed AMSI and logging to stay stealthy

Always check LNK files, encoded strings, and suspicious outbound connections when dealing with memory forensics.

**Mission accomplished. ‚úÖ**
