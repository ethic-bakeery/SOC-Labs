## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Manual Email Analysis (Following [Checklist](http://website.com/checklist))

---

## üîç Initial Triage

We first determine whether the received email is malicious or a false positive.

- **Subject Line (translated):**  
  *"Your Livelo points will expire soon - PROTOCOL: 57949307."*

- **Sender:**  
  `Bradesco <sac@bradesco.com.br>`

- **Initial Checks:**
  - Email seems legitimate at first glance.
  - Looked up `sac@bradesco.com.br` on VirusTotal: **Not flagged**.
  - However, **authentication checks failed**:

    ```text
    Authentication-Results:
      spf=temperror (sender IP is 147.182.193.196)
      dkim=none (message not signed)
      dmarc=fail action=none
      compauth=fail reason=001
    ```

  - Sender IP: `147.182.193.196` ‚Üí flagged **malicious** on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

## ‚úâÔ∏è Email Header Analysis

Key findings from the headers:

- **From:** `Bradesco <sac@bradesco.com.br>`  
  Can be spoofed ‚Äì not reliable.

- **Return-Path:** `root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb-sfo3-01`  
  Suggests email was sent from a Linux server (likely compromised).

- **Authentication Failures:**
    - SPF: temperror
    - DKIM: none
    - DMARC: fail
    - CompAuth: fail

- **Tools Used:** [MxToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Tools/EmailHeaders.aspx?huid=9361be5a-e34a-4859-93be-8a726c9d0dcf)

## üìé Attachment Analysis

- No traditional file attachments.
- The phishing content is embedded in **Base64-encoded HTML**.
- Decoded HTML contains this **malicious URL**:  
  `https://function-9-zka7zvb73a-rj.a.run.app`
