- [email source ](https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot/blob/main/email/sample-1005.eml)
## 🔍 Initial Triage

- **Subject Line**: "#CRYPTO#" (Highly generic/suspicious subject)
- **Sender**: "Mary <noreply@att.net>" (Potential spoofing of AT&T domain)
- **Initial Checks**:
  - Email claims to be from AT&T but shows multiple red flags
  - Authentication checks failed:
  ![email failed](./images/email/failed-005.PNG)
    ```text
    Authentication-Results: 
      spf=none (sender IP is 192.232.233.127) 
      smtp.mailfrom=att.net; 
      dkim=ignore (ignored public key size) 
      header.d=heritagejewelryandloan.com;
      dmarc=none action=none
    ```
  - Sender IP: `192.232.233.127` (belongs to heritagejewelryandloan.com, not AT&T)
  - Contains suspicious Base64 encoded HTML content
  - Multiple recipients in CC field (spray-and-pray tactic)

While checking `192.232.233.127` reputation on `Abusedb` it shows `0` reputation

## ✉️ Email Header Analysis

Key findings from the headers:

- **From**: "Mary <noreply@att.net>" (Display name doesn't match AT&T's typical format)
- **Return-Path**: `root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb-sfo3-01` (Indicates sent from a cloud server)
- **Reply-To**: `noreply@att.net` (Matches From address but still suspicious)
- **Message-ID**: `<BCAAD0A3.7732363@att.net>` (Format looks legitimate but could be spoofed)
- **Received**: Shows multiple hops through Outlook servers before reaching final destination
- **X-AntiAbuse**: Contains multiple headers suggesting the email was sent through heritagejewelryandloan.com
- **X-Sender-IP**: `192.232.233.127` (Matches sending IP)
- **X-Mailer**: Mozilla/5.0 Thunderbird/38.0.0 (Unusual for corporate email)
- **CC**: phishing@pot, collin@colony.io, chris.pierce360@gmail.com, raminhenke@gmail.com (which clearly indicate the phising target many victims)

## 📎 Attachment Analysis

- No traditional file attachments found
- Email contains Base64-encoded HTML content with suspicious image
- Decoded HTML reveals:
  - Obfuscated CSS styles (unusual for legitimate emails)
  - Hidden tracking image
  - Suspicious "#CURL#" placeholder that would likely be replaced with malicious URL in actual attack

---

## 🔗 URL and Link Analysis

- No visible links in plain text body
- HTML contains obfuscated code that would likely generate malicious links when rendered
- Image uses data URI scheme (base64 encoded) to avoid URL detection
- Potential redirection through "#CURL#" placeholder

---

## 📝 Email Body Analysis

- **Language**: Very minimal content (just "#CURL#"), highly suspicious
- **Impersonation**: Attempts to appear as AT&T email but fails authentication
- **Technique**: Uses minimal content to bypass filters, relies on HTML payload
- **Obfuscation**: Heavy use of CSS obfuscation and base64 encoding
- **Target**: Sent to multiple recipients (spray-and-pray approach)

---

## 🛠 Infrastructure Analysis

- **Sending Domain**: heritagejewelryandloan.com
- **Sending IP**: 192.232.233.127 (Linode LLC)
- **Tools Used**:
  - Exim mail server (version 4.91)
  - Sent from a Linux server (Ubuntu)
- **X-AntiAbuse Headers**: Indicate sender was authenticated as info@heritagejewelryandloan.com

---
